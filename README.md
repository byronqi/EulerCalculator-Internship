# Euler Calculator
***
### Description
This is a calculator for obtaining Euler numbers for HTXR.\
This calculator takes into account for both staggered and square formation tubes. This includes Square, Square 45, Triangle 30, Triangle 60.\
Reynolds numbers from 1 to 1000000 (1E6) are accounted for. Anything beyond or below the range is extrapolated.
